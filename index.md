% uze, a module ecosystem for zsh

[Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) deserve an ecosystem to test, share, deploy and love
it the way we do with all your dynamic langages.

We're perfectly aware have flaws: all the programming langages does.

Yet, zsh have no competitor when it comes to get simple things done and
many of us use it daily because zsh programming makes a lot of things simple.
it is

* distributed (over ssh)
* parallel (over pipes and fifo)
* extensible with any programming langage as any command can be run from zsh
* with some functional programming features
    * symbols can carry command names
    * piping is the easiest way to create closures
    * everything is stateless in a pipe
* comming with the most productive REPL ever, daily used by most of unix users
